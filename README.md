Rock, paper, scissors.

I decided to build a small program in order to clarify how the control flow work using functions.
This small program is written in JavaScript to simulate the classic two player game that is used all over the world to play for fun or at very often times just to decide the undecidable.

This program uses:

functions.
if statements.
if else statements.
nested if statements.
switch cases.
But most importanly, it shows how the control flow works.

The project taught me not to overthink too much, but just starting with the first few lines of code, testing them by logging them to the console and make whatever necessary adjustments right away should any stand to be corrected. After that, I would say it was more like copying and pasting the majority lines of code and then think of what I wanted to change and replace the corresponding code.

The project is used or played by invoking playGame() and then it shows what you pulled and what the computer pulled. You can do this as many times as you can, and it will always display a random result. You can either win, the computer could win, or both the computer and you can tie. However, I included a cheat word 'fire'; by typing this word you will win at all times no matter what the computer pulls.
